# Omega

Omega is a Discord bot for miscellaneous server administration functions designed for the SlateStarCodex Discord server.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install discord, requests, and dotenv.

```bash
pip install discord
pip install requests
pip install dotenv
```

You'll also need a .env file with your own [Google API key](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/overview) and you'll need to set this up with your own [Discord bot token](https://discord.com/developers/applications/).

## Usage

Currently all of the commands are viewable by typing `!o scott help` and should be pretty self-explanatory. Feel free to hop into the server and ask me directly if you have any questions.
